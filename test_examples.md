# Crispify Test Examples

## Test Input 1: Short News (Your example)
**Input:** "New Mexico health officials said they have confirmed the first human case of the plague in the state in 2025, occurring in a 43-year-old male from Valencia County who recently went camping."

**Expected Output:** Something like: "New Mexico confirmed its first plague case of 2025. The patient is a 43-year-old man from Valencia County who went camping recently."

## Test Input 2: Very Short Text
**Input:** "The quarterly earnings report exceeded analysts' expectations with a 23% increase in revenue."

**Expected Output:** "The company's earnings grew 23% more than expected this quarter."

## Test Input 3: Medium Technical Text
**Input:** "The implementation of quantum computing algorithms in cryptographic applications has demonstrated significant computational advantages over classical approaches, particularly in factorization problems and discrete logarithm calculations, which form the mathematical foundation of many current encryption standards."

**Expected Output:** "Quantum computers can solve certain math problems much faster than regular computers. This speed helps break codes that protect information. These problems are the basis of many security systems we use today."

## Test Input 4: Long Medical Text
**Input:** "Recent longitudinal studies examining the correlation between dietary fiber intake and cardiovascular health outcomes have revealed statistically significant inverse relationships, with individuals consuming 25-35 grams of fiber daily demonstrating a 40% reduction in coronary heart disease risk compared to those with intake below 15 grams, after adjusting for confounding variables including age, BMI, physical activity levels, and socioeconomic factors."

**Expected Output:** "Studies show that eating more fiber helps protect your heart. People who eat 25-35 grams of fiber each day have 40% less risk of heart disease than those who eat less than 15 grams. This is true even when considering age, weight, exercise, and income levels."

## How the Improvements Work

### 1. **Adaptive Prompting**
- **Short texts (<25 words):** Focus on concise 1-2 sentence rewrites
- **Medium texts (25-75 words):** Balanced 2-3 sentence simplification  
- **Long texts (>75 words):** Extract key information in 3-4 sentences

### 2. **Better Model Parameters**
```cpp
// Optimized for Gemma-3 QAT model
params.temp = 0.8f;           // Balanced creativity
params.top_p = 0.92f;         // Good diversity
params.top_k = 50;            // Reasonable variety
params.min_p = 0.05f;         // Filter low probability
params.penalty_repeat = 1.1f; // Reduce repetition
```

### 3. **Chat Template Support**
- Uses model's built-in chat template when available
- Properly formats system/user messages
- Includes few-shot example when appropriate

### 4. **Critical Fixes from PR #13**
- Dynamic batch sizing prevents crashes
- Proper token counting and limits
- Efficient streaming without duplication
- Better memory management

## Installation & Testing

1. Install the debug APK:
```bash
./gradlew installDebug
```

2. Test on device:
- Open any app with selectable text
- Select text and choose "Crispify" from the toolbar
- Observe the simplified output

## Key Improvements Over Previous Version

1. **No hardcoded prompts** - Adapts to text length
2. **Better for various topics** - Not optimized for just one type
3. **Stability** - PR #13 fixes prevent crashes
4. **Performance** - Optimized tokenization and streaming
5. **Quality** - Better sampling parameters for Gemma model
