# Post-Implementation Completion Plan

## Context
The first-launch-screen feature implementation (5 tasks) has been completed but the post-execution workflow from Agent OS was not triggered. This document provides steps to properly complete the workflow according to Agent OS conventions.

## Current State
- **Branch**: Currently on `main` (should be on feature branch)
- **Tasks**: All 5 parent tasks implemented but not marked complete in `tasks.md`
- **Changes**: Multiple files created/modified but not committed
- **Spec**: `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/`

## Required Actions

### 1. Create Feature Branch and Move Changes
Since work was done directly on main, we need to move it to a feature branch:

```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch (following Agent OS naming convention)
git checkout -b first-launch-screen

# The changes will automatically move to the new branch
```

### 2. Update Task Status
Mark all completed tasks in `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/tasks.md`:
- Mark each parent task (1-5) with `[x]`
- Mark all subtasks with `[x]`
- Document any blockers if tasks couldn't be completed

### 3. Execute Post-Implementation Workflow
Following `.agent-os/instructions/core/post-execution-tasks.md`, complete these steps:

#### Step 1: Run Full Test Suite
```bash
./gradlew test
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest  # if device available
```
Fix any failures before proceeding.

#### Step 2: Git Workflow
- Stage all changes: `git add -A`
- Create descriptive commit following project conventions
- Push to GitHub: `git push -u origin first-launch-screen`
- Create PR targeting main branch using `gh pr create`

Include in PR description:
- Summary of implemented features
- Reference to spec: `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/`
- Test status

#### Step 3: Verify Task Completion
Review `.agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/tasks.md` to ensure:
- All tasks marked with `[x]`
- Any blockers documented
- Status accurate

#### Step 4: Roadmap Update (if applicable)
Check if this spec completes any items in `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md`:
- If yes, mark relevant roadmap items with `[x]`
- If no, skip this step

#### Step 5: Create Recap Document
Create `.agent-os/recaps/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen.md`:

```markdown
# [2025-08-28] Recap: First Launch Screen

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the first-launch onboarding screen for Crispify with model initialization, diagnostics opt-in, and proper state management. The implementation includes:

- Complete UI with Material 3 components and theming
- State management using ViewModel and DataStore Preferences
- Model initialization system with progress tracking
- Diagnostics manager with privacy-preserving opt-in
- Navigation integration with first-launch detection

## Context

[Copy summary from spec-lite.md]
```

#### Step 6: Generate Completion Summary
Create a final summary message with:

```markdown
## âœ… What's been done

1. **First Launch Screen UI** - Created complete onboarding interface with Material 3
2. **State Management** - Implemented ViewModel with DataStore persistence
3. **Model Initialization** - Built system for LLM model loading with progress
4. **Navigation Integration** - Added first-launch detection and routing
5. **Diagnostics System** - Created privacy-preserving opt-in diagnostics

## ðŸ‘€ Ready to test

1. Clear app data to trigger first launch
2. Launch app to see onboarding screen
3. Toggle diagnostics preference
4. Complete onboarding flow

## ðŸ“¦ Pull Request

View PR: [GitHub PR URL will be here after creation]
```

#### Step 7: Play Notification Sound
```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Glass.aiff  # macOS
# or appropriate command for your OS
```

## Important Notes

- **Branch Protection**: The pre-commit hook in `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-checks.sh` prevents direct commits to main, so the feature branch is required
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure all tests pass before creating PR
- **PR Review**: The GitHub Actions will run Claude Code Review automatically
- **Context Preservation**: This workflow ensures all implementation context is properly documented

## Quick Execution Command Sequence

For rapid execution by an agent with existing context:

```bash
# 1. Switch to feature branch
git checkout -b first-launch-screen

# 2. Run tests
./gradlew test

# 3. Stage and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: implement first launch onboarding screen

- Add Material 3 UI components for onboarding
- Implement state management with DataStore
- Create model initialization system
- Add diagnostics opt-in functionality
- Integrate with navigation flow

Spec: .agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin first-launch-screen
gh pr create --title "Feature: First Launch Onboarding Screen" --body "..."

# 5. Update tasks.md with [x] markers
# 6. Create recap document
# 7. Play completion sound
```

This completes the Agent OS workflow for the first-launch-screen implementation.
