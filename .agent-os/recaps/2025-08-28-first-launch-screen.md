# [2025-08-28] Recap: First Launch Screen

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-28-first-launch-screen/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the complete first-launch onboarding screen for Crispify with model initialization, diagnostics opt-in, and proper state management. The implementation includes:

- Complete UI with Material 3 components and theming
- State management using ViewModel and DataStore Preferences
- Model initialization system with progress tracking
- Privacy-preserving diagnostics manager with opt-in
- Navigation integration with first-launch detection
- ProcessTextActivity for ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT intent handling

## Context

The First Launch Screen serves as the critical entry point for new Crispify users, handling three essential functions:

1. **Model Initialization**: Preparing the on-device LLM for text processing with visual progress feedback
2. **Privacy Control**: Offering opt-in local diagnostics while maintaining absolute privacy (no INTERNET permission)
3. **User Education**: Providing clear instructions on how to use Crispify through the text selection menu

This implementation follows the privacy-first principles outlined in the PRD, ensuring all processing happens on-device with no data leaving the user's phone.

## What Was Built

### 1. FirstLaunchScreen UI Components ✅
- Created `FirstLaunchScreen.kt` with Material 3 design
- Implemented LinearProgressIndicator showing model loading progress
- Added diagnostics Switch component with clear labeling
- Created dismissal Button that's disabled during loading
- Applied proper theming and responsive layout constraints

### 2. State Management & Persistence ✅
- Built `FirstLaunchViewModel` with StateFlow for reactive UI
- Integrated DataStore Preferences for persistent storage
- Implemented first-launch flag to show screen only once
- Added diagnostics preference persistence
- Ensured proper handling of configuration changes

### 3. Model Initialization System ✅
- Created `LlamaEngine` class with progress callback mechanism
- Implemented `ModelInitializer` interface for abstraction
- Added JNI wrapper stubs (`LlamaNativeLibrary`) for future llama.cpp integration
- Built `MockLlamaNativeLibrary` for development and testing
- Connected model loading progress to UI updates

### 4. Navigation & App Entry Point ✅
- Updated `MainActivity` to detect and handle first launch
- Created `ProcessTextActivity` for text selection handling
- Configured AndroidManifest with ACTION_PROCESS_TEXT intent filter
- Implemented proper navigation flow and back button handling
- Added translucent theme for ProcessTextActivity overlay

### 5. DiagnosticsManager System ✅
- Built privacy-preserving local diagnostics collection
- Implemented opt-in/opt-out logic (disabled by default)
- Created metric collection for TTFT, tokens/sec, memory usage
- Added human-readable export format with interpretations
- Guaranteed no network operations (no INTERNET permission)

## Technical Highlights

### Privacy Guarantees
- No INTERNET permission in AndroidManifest.xml
- All data processing happens on-device
- Diagnostics are opt-in and store no user content
- Data is cleared when diagnostics are disabled

### Architecture Patterns
- MVVM pattern with ViewModel and StateFlow
- Repository pattern with DataStore
- Dependency injection via Factory pattern
- Clean separation of concerns across layers

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests for ViewModels and business logic
- Instrumented tests for Compose UI
- Mock implementations for development
- Test-driven development approach

## Files Created/Modified

## Next Steps

1. Review and merge the PR
2. Test on physical devices with various Android versions
3. Integrate actual llama.cpp library when ready
4. Fine-tune the leveling prompt based on user feedback
5. Add analytics to track model performance metrics

## Completion Status

All 5 parent tasks and 36 subtasks have been completed successfully. The implementation is ready for integration testing and user feedback.
