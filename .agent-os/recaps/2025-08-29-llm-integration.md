# [2025-08-29] Recap: LLM Integration

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-29-llm-integration/spec.md.

## Recap

Implemented the foundation for native llama.cpp integration via JNI wrapper to enable on-device text simplification with GGUF models. The implementation establishes the complete build infrastructure and API design for token-by-token streaming while maintaining absolute privacy through local-only processing.

## Context

From spec summary: Implement native llama.cpp integration via JNI wrapper to enable on-device text simplification with GGUF models. The integration provides token-by-token streaming, progress callbacks during model loading, and ensures all processing happens locally without internet connectivity for absolute privacy.

This work builds upon the existing ProcessTextActivity infrastructure and replaces the mock implementation with real language model capabilities, following the PRD's privacy-first principles and single-feature scope.

## What Was Built

### 1. Native Build Infrastructure ✅ (Task 1 - Complete)
- **NDK Setup**: Updated app/build.gradle.kts with NDK r25c configuration and arm64-v8a ABI filter
- **CMake Integration**: Created CMakeLists.txt with target name "crispify_llama" matching Kotlin expectations
- **JNI Stub Framework**: Implemented initial C++ JNI stub files (crispify_jni.cpp) with proper method signatures
- **Development Model Asset**: Added gemma-3-270m-it-Q4_K_M.gguf to app/src/main/assets/ for local testing
- **Test Infrastructure**: Created Kotlin unit tests with fake native layer for development workflow
- **Build Verification**: Confirmed native library loads successfully in test environment

### 2. Streaming API Design ✅ (Task 0 - Complete)
- **TokenCallback Interface**: Updated LlamaNativeLibrary interface to support token streaming callback
- **API Signature Change**: Replaced processText(String): String with processText(String, TokenCallback) for real-time updates
- **JNI Compatibility**: Defined TokenCallback as Java SAM interface compatible with JNI threading model
- **ViewModel Integration**: Updated ProcessTextViewModel to consume real token stream instead of pseudo-streaming
- **Metrics Accuracy**: Fixed TTFT calculation to measure first actual token arrival rather than mock timing
- **Threading Model**: Documented threading approach and cancellation mechanism for native operations

### 3. Pending Implementation (Tasks 2-5 - Not Complete)
- **JNI Wrapper Methods**: Core loadModel(), processText(), and memory management methods await implementation
- **llama.cpp Integration**: Library integration and model context management not yet implemented  
- **Model Asset System**: Simplified asset-based model loading system needs completion
- **End-to-End Testing**: Integration tests for complete flow pending actual native implementation

## Technical Highlights

### Build System Enhancements
- NDK r25c integration with CMake support
- ARM64-v8a architecture targeting for optimal performance
- Native library loading verification in test suite
- Development-ready GGUF model asset bundling

### API Design Improvements  
- Token-by-token streaming interface design
- Progress callback system for model loading
- Clean separation between mock and production implementations
- Thread-safe callback mechanism for JNI integration

### Development Workflow
- Test-driven approach with unit tests preceding implementation
- Mock layer enabling parallel UI and native development
- Build verification ensuring native components integrate properly
- Asset-based development model for testing without network dependencies

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created (5)
- CMakeLists.txt - Native build configuration
- app/src/main/cpp/crispify_jni.cpp - JNI stub implementation
- app/src/main/assets/gemma-3-270m-it-Q4_K_M.gguf - Development model asset
- Updated test files for native library verification
- Build configuration updates for NDK integration

### Modified Files (3)
- app/build.gradle.kts - Added NDK and CMake configuration  
- LlamaNativeLibrary.kt - Updated interface for streaming API
- ProcessTextViewModel.kt - Enhanced for real token consumption

## Completion Status

**Task 0 (API Design): Complete** - All 6 subtasks completed
**Task 1 (Build Infrastructure): Complete** - All 6 subtasks completed  
**Tasks 2-5 (Implementation): Pending** - 25 subtasks remain for full llama.cpp integration

The foundation is now established for native LLM integration. The next phase will implement the actual JNI wrapper methods, integrate the llama.cpp library, and complete end-to-end testing with real model inference.

## Next Steps

1. Implement core JNI wrapper methods (Task 2)
2. Integrate llama.cpp library as submodule or prebuilt dependency (Task 3)
3. Complete model asset loading and validation system (Task 4)
4. Execute comprehensive end-to-end integration testing (Task 5)
5. Performance optimization and memory management validation
