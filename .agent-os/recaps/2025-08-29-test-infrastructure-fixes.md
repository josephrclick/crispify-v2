# 2025-08-29 Recap: Test Infrastructure Fixes

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-08-29-test-infrastructure-fixes/spec.md.

## Recap

We stabilized the test suite after the streaming API migration by moving to deterministic coroutine testing, fixing Mockito-Kotlin patterns, and hardening UI tests.

- Migrated coroutine tests to `runTest` and removed timing-based `delay` usage
- Added `MainDispatcherRule` and applied across coroutine-heavy tests
- Implemented `TestPreferencesManager` using a temp-file-backed DataStore and added tests
- Fixed Mockito-Kotlin stubbing with null-safe `any/eq` and proper `doAnswer` for callbacks
- Added Compose test tags and `waitForIdle` to make UI tests reliable
- Aligned token limit pre-check to PRD (perform before engine init)

## Context

Fix the test infrastructure to resolve failing tests caused by the streaming API migration by implementing proper coroutine testing patterns with `runTest`, fixing Mockito-Kotlin suspend function mocking, and ensuring deterministic test execution without timing-dependent failures.
