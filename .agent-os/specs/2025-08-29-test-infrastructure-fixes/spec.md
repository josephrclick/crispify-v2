## Overview

Fix the test infrastructure to resolve 15 failing tests caused by the streaming API migration. This will ensure a stable, deterministic test suite that properly handles asynchronous coroutine operations and Kotlin-specific mocking requirements.

## User Stories

### Developer Testing Experience

As a developer, I want to run the test suite with confidence, so that I can verify my changes don't break existing functionality.

Currently, 15 tests are failing due to timing issues with coroutines and improper mock configuration for suspend functions. Developers need a reliable test suite that runs deterministically without arbitrary delays, properly mocks Kotlin suspend functions, and provides clear feedback when tests fail. This enables confident development and prevents regression bugs from reaching production.

## Spec Scope

1. **Coroutine Test Migration** - Replace runBlocking with runTest and use virtual time control
2. **Mockito-Kotlin Configuration** - Fix suspend function mocking with onBlocking patterns
3. **DataStore Test Implementation** - Create test-specific DataStore for Robolectric compatibility
4. **Compose UI Test Setup** - Add proper test tags and compose test rules
5. **Test Dispatcher Management** - Implement MainDispatcherRule for consistent dispatcher handling

## Out of Scope

- Adding new feature tests
- Performance optimization of production code
- Changing the streaming API implementation
- Upgrading testing framework versions

## Expected Deliverable

1. All 49 tests passing with 100% success rate
2. Deterministic test execution without timing-dependent failures
3. Proper mock configuration for all suspend functions and coroutines
