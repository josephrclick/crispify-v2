# Test Infrastructure Fixes - Lite Summary

Fix the test infrastructure to resolve 15 failing tests caused by the streaming API migration by implementing proper coroutine testing patterns with runTest, fixing Mockito-Kotlin suspend function mocking, and ensuring deterministic test execution without timing-dependent failures.

## Key Points
- Migrate all test cases to use runTest for proper coroutine testing with TestDispatcher
- Fix Mockito-Kotlin suspend function mocking patterns for streaming API methods
- Eliminate timing-dependent test failures through deterministic state verification
