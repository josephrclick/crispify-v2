# Spec Summary (Lite)

Complete the llama.cpp inference implementation to enable on-device text simplification with real-time token streaming. This replaces the current stub implementation with actual model inference, allowing Crispify to simplify complex text to a 7th-9th grade reading level using the integrated GGUF model while maintaining absolute privacy through local processing.
