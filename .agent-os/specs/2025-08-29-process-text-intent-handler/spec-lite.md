# Spec Summary (Lite)

Enable Crispify to appear in Androidâ€™s Process Text toolbar so users can send selected text from any app to a bottom-sheet flow that simplifies it on-device and offers copy-to-clipboard output. Respect read-only contexts, enforce input limits per PRD, and present simple error states without any network access.
