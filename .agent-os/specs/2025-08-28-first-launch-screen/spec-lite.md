# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a First Launch screen that provides initial onboarding when users open Crispify directly from their home screen. The screen explains how to use the app via text selection, handles the initial model preparation with a progress indicator, and offers an optional diagnostics opt-in toggle before user-controlled dismissal.
